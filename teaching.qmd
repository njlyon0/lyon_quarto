title: "Courses & Workshops"
---

I'm a deeply enthusiastic person generally and one of the things that brings me the most joy is teaching and learning with others. As such, I have repeatedly sought out opportunities to teach in contexts ranging from hour-long workshops all the way to year-long courses. See a list of those below along with--where applicable--additional resources.

## Workshops

Note that these workshops were designed to be offered repeatedly to different audiences. As such, while each of these workshops is only identified once I have been part of the teaching team for all of them _many_ times. All resources are "living" so that participants from earlier iterations of a given workshop find the most up-to-date version of the materials when they revisit their old bookmarks.
