title: "Talks"

I love chatting about science and data management and leap at the opportunity to present in public-facing contexts. Here is a breakdown of some of the conference talks, workshops, and lectures I have given as well as the semester-long courses I have taught. The icons to the left of the titles (e.g., {{< fa screwdriver-wrench >}}) are intended to help roughly group content by their topic.
