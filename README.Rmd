# Nick J Lyon Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website's repository!

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and you can view the published version [here](https://njlyon0.github.io/).

```{r rendering function, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd")
```
