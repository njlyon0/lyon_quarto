    "text": "I am an early career data scientist with experience managing ecological data in a range of formats. In my personal research I pursued projects that allowed me to blend field, analytical, and modeling approaches to ask and answer community-level questions; this approach gave me first hand experience in both the tidying of raw data and the analysis and visualization of wrangled data.\nThe bulk of my coding experience is in R but I also have moderate competency with SQL and have self-taught R Shiny. I plan on learning more coding languages going forward as data challenges necessitate.\nI firmly believe in transparency in data management and am an avid git user.

I plan on learning more coding languages going forward as data challenges necessitate.\nI firmly believe in transparency in data management and am an avid git user. Check out my GitHub profile for a selection of the public repositories that I own.\nI am particularly proud of my work on the lterpalettefinder package, my personal ‘toolbox’ package helpR and the R Shiny data portal that I created for the Hebivory Variability Network. My code is well-commented and is meant to provide a clear window into the function and rationale of each operation.\nIn addition to data management, teaching and communicating scientific results are also things I love and hope to continue to focus on as my career develops. While a graduate student I sought out opportunities to teach and have guest lectured and taught labs in ecology, introductory biology, and multivariate analysis. I’ve developed R tutorials in an introduction to multivariate analysis, an introduction to random forest and best practices in quality control\nPerhaps unsurprisingly for a data scientist such as myself but I am a huge Dungeons & Dragons fan and have begun working on a package (dndR) that serves any other people in the R / DnD Venn Diagram intersection."

    "text": "I am driven to be the kind of instructor who combines honest care for students with effective teaching practices and critical self-reflection to improve because those are the types of faculty that had the largest positive impact on my personal and professional lives. I have found that being this type of teacher is often synonymous with being a mentor and it is this role that I find especially attractive in pursuing a career in academia. Whether students are taking my classes because this particular subject is their passion or simply satisfying a non-major requirement, my philosophy is to teach from a place of empathy with the lives and struggles of the students in my classes, and this style of teaching is often conducive to forming mentor-mentee relationships with many students. I have been able to live out this philosophy with undergraduate students both in formal classroom contexts and in less structured field season and independent research contexts. I have served as a teaching assistant (TA) for several classes including an upper level (i.e., junior & senior) ecology course and two introductory general biology courses (open to all grades). My teaching emphasizes transparency with students, constructive and thorough feedback, and frequent requests for (anonymized) student feedback on how my teaching could better serve them. I believe that students thrive (both personally and professionally) when the intended learning objectives of every assignment and lecture is communicated in a clear and concise way early and often. Students then understand what concept I am pushing them to grapple with in an assignment rather than becoming overly focused on the point value of said task. My open-door policy for student feedback also makes students feel listened to and welcome as colleagues into the classrooms I instruct and frequently their feedback improves my teaching in ways I would never have thought of alone. Here is an example of the kind of PowerPoints I create to discussion and engagement. I also leap at the opportunity to guest lecture for courses whenever possible. So far the bulk of my experience with that type of teaching has been in the form of guest lectures on the statistical software R. This program has become increasingly widely used in published literature and is regarded as a valuable skill for graduate school so singular guest lectures on facets of R relevant to a particular course, unit, or project are useful. Provided below is a list of the guest lectures I have given to date and I am happy to share the materials I have created for these courses so just contact me if you’re interested!
