This workshop was aimed at participants with moderate R knowledge but little to no prior experience with R Shiny. I created a Quarto website for the workshop to allow participants to follow along on the day of the workshop and also house resources they could refer back to on their own as needed.\nWe began with the fundamentals of Shiny and ended by live coding an interactive app that was moderately complex. We shared the  GitHub repository for the workshop website with attendees and I created a standalone  GitHub repository to house example apps for them to use as jumping off points."

This group was particularly interested in the drivers of and variation in export of silica from rivers around the world. Riverine silica export is significant–in part–because diatoms in the ocean are silica limited. Diatoms are important marine photosynthesizers and their populations can have a direct impact on carbon sequestration and, indirectly, climate change.\nThis working group had annual data on silica concentrations from hundreds of rivers around the globe. They had created plots of these data showing the relationship between silica (y) and time (x) and wanted to (1) identify significant changes in the slope in each line, (2) “break” the line at those places, and (3) fit separate linear models to each section of the line to be able to assess rates of change. After a few initial conversations so that I could better understand their needs I set to work building a workflow that could meet their needs. I periodically met with the principal investigators of this team to discuss my progress and ask for clarification at points where a judgement call needed to be made by a subject matter expert.\nThe products of that work are housed in this  GitHub repository and make heavy use of the HERON R package I am developing to support this task and a few related repositories created for the same working group."

    "text": "Lyon MS Thesis - Native Bee Restoration Ecology\n\nI earned my Master of Science at Iowa State University in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology program and the focus of my thesis was restoration community ecology of Midwestern pollinators and nectar-producing plants. One facet of this work was a side question I pursued on the response of native bees to combinations of annual prescribed fire and cattle grazing.\nNative bees don’t form hives in the way that European honey bees do and many of them make solitary nests in stems or by digging small (and very cute!) holes in patches of bare ground. Fire and cattle grazing change the availability both of bare ground and dead stems and these management methods also altar the composition of the floral community. I hypothesized that the changes to the bees’ food sources and habitat would change the bee community and set out to test the extent to which this was the case.\nAs is sometimes the case with ecology research, I had a wonderful time collecting the data but they were so zero-inflated (i.e., there were so many times when I didn’t find any bees in my traps) that the data weren’t really analyzable. That said I made a  GitHub repository for my exploration and initial quality control of the data and made it public.\nI also shared the data on the Environmental Data Initiative’s Data Portal in case someone else could find a use for them. I’ve linked that data package here"
