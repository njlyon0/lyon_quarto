These codes can then be used for the creation of graphics that have aesthetic connections to pictures relevant to the data (e.g., focal organism, study site, etc.). Secondarily, it also contains a set of “official” palettes that can be accessed if the user would prefer to use a pre-set palette rather than deriving their own."

To blend my personal and professional interests I’ve created this package (dndR) to serve any other people in the R / DnD Venn Diagram intersection. It allows for easy rolling of dice, creation of character statistics, and (for GMs) encounter balancing. This package is also a fun chance for me to practice my coding skills in a risk-free environment."
