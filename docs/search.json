    "text": "I am an early career data scientist with experience managing ecological data in a range of formats. I have firsthand experience with designing field experiments and writing models and this has granted me invaluable insight into the quality assurance and control (QA/QC) needs of typical scientific projects.\nThe bulk of my coding experience is in R but I also have moderate competency with SQL and have self-taught R Shiny. I plan on learning more coding languages going forward as data challenges necessitate.\nI firmly believe in transparency in data management and am an avid git user. Check out my GitHub profile for examples of my ongoing and past work!\n\n\nI am particularly proud of my work as the lead author on the lterpalettefinder R package. This R package accepts a photo and identifies the hexadecimal codes for the top 25 most different colors in that photo. This is really great when you want to have a plot’s aesthetics have a tight relationship to a picture of a study organism or research site! CRAN submission is on the horizon so stay tuned!"

To blend my personal and professional interests I’ve begun working on an R package called dndR that serves any other people in the R / DnD Venn Diagram intersection. This package is also a fun chance for me to practice my coding skills in a risk-free environment"
