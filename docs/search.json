It allows for easy rolling of dice, creation of character statistics, and (for GMs) encounter balancing. This package is also a fun chance for me to practice my coding skills in a risk-free environment.\nTo help showcase some of the functions in dndR I’ve created a standalone Quarto website that is similar to a vignette.
