**While I recommend checking out [my CV](https://github.com/njlyon0/njlyon0.github.io/blob/main/files/LyonCV.pdf) for a more complete history of my career thus far**, I am including more holistic descriptions of my programming-focused positions below.

## LTER Network Office

I worked as a member of the Scientific Computing Support Team for the [LTER Network Office](https://lternet.edu/) housed at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)). While on this team, I supported the analytical, quality control, and data acquisition and management needs of five synthesis working groups comprised of dozens of working scientists and managers.

Specifically, I created the [Quarto website for the team](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/) and helped in the creation of [GitHub](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp-workshop-collaborative-coding/) and [`tidyverse`](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp-workshop-tidyverse/) workshops. I also designed a [tutorial on building websites with Quarto](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/tutorials.html#building-a-website-with-quarto) to facilitate a more 'go at your own pace' approach to teaching coding skills. Additionally, I discussed a set of [coding "best practices"](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/best_practices.html) recommendations with my team and then created brief explanations of these on our website.

## Herbivory Variability Network

I worked as the Data Scientist / Network Administrator for the Herbivory Variability Network (aka [HerbVar](https://herbvar.org/)) housed at Michigan State University and led by [Dr. Will Wetzel](https://wetzellab.com/). While in that role I designed significant components of their wrangling pipeline and optimized some workflows that predated my hiring. Many of HerbVar's repositories are private (at least until publication!) but their GitHub Organization can be found [here](https://github.com/HerbVar-Network). 

One significant task I accomplished for HerbVar that is public was their [R Shiny Data Portal](https://herbvar.shinyapps.io/data_portal_actual/). The portal allowed HerbVar network members to attach data, enter associated metadata, and even performed preliminary quality control prior to submission! The GitHub repository for the portal can be found [here](https://github.com/HerbVar-Network/Data-Portal)
