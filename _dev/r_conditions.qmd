### Signaling Conditions (Ch. 8)

| **Condition** | **Severity** | **Description** | **Function** |
|:---:|:---:|:-----------------------------|:---:|
| Error | Most | Indicates that the function _cannot_ continue and execution must stop | `stop()` |
| Warning | Intermediate | Indicates something has gone wrong but the function could at least partially recover | `warning()` |
| Message | Least | Indicates that an action has been taken on the user's behalf but not necessarily a problem | `message()` |
