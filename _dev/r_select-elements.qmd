### `[`, `[[`, and `$` (Ch. 4)

If `x` is a train with multiple cars and each car contains multiple items:

- `x[1]` grabs the whole first train car
- `x[[1]]` grabs the _contents of_ the whole first train car
- `x$1` is shorthand for `x[[1]]`

`[[` versus `$`

If `name` is an object containing one of the names in `x`,

- `x[[name]]` will get the entity that matches the _value_ of `name`
- `x$name` will get an entity that _is itself named_ `name`
