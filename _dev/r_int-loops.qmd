### Looping Across Integers (Ch. 5)

When you're looping across integers, it can be really tempting to use `1:length(x)` in the definition of the loop (I know I've done this!). However, if some issue in the code and/or data causes `x` to have a length of 0, you'll get some bizarre behavior that may be very hard to debug. Instead if you use `seq_along(x)` you'll never get atypical behavior because if `x` has length 0 the loop will simply run once (because it will return "1" even when whatever its sequencing along with has no elements).

Your loop wouldn't work in either case but at least with `seq_along` it'll be immediately clear that the problem is with `x`.
