# Pages Under Development

By default, all `.qmd`, `.Rmd`, and `.md` files in the project directory for a Quarto website are rendered. This is a desireable behavior in some respects but a pain when you want to work on files that are not yet ready for full inclusion in the website but want to track your progress with Git. Fortunately, **directories preceded by a "_" are not rendered**.

So, files in this folder represent pages I'm working on but that I don't want to be rendered or included in the deployed site (or at least not yet).
