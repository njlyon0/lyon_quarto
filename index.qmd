## Welcome!

I am an early career data scientist with experience managing ecological data in a range of formats. I have firsthand experience with designing field experiments and writing models and this has granted me invaluable insight into the quality assurance and control (QA/QC) needs of typical scientific projects.

The bulk of my coding experience is in R but I also have moderate competency with SQL and have self-taught R Shiny. I plan on learning more coding languages going forward as data challenges necessitate.

I firmly believe in transparency in data management and am an avid `git` user. Check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/njlyon0){target="_blank"} for examples of my ongoing and past work!

### Professional Spotlight - `lterpalettefinder`

I am particularly proud of my work as the lead author on the [`lterpalettefinder` R package](https://github.com/lter/lterpalettefinder#readme){target="_blank"}. This R package accepts a photo and identifies the hexadecimal codes for the top 25 most different colors in that photo. This is really great when you want to have a plot's aesthetics have a tight relationship to a picture of a study organism or research site! CRAN submission is on the horizon so stay tuned!

## Personal Spotlight - `dndR`

Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone of my professional interests but I am a *huge* Dungeons & Dragons fan in my free time. To blend my personal and professional interests I've begun working on an R package called [`dndR`](https://github.com/njlyon0/dndR#readme){target="_blank"} that serves any other people in the R / DnD Venn Diagram intersection. This package is also a fun chance for me to practice my coding skills in a risk-free environment
