## Welcome!

I am an early career data scientist with experience managing ecological data in a range of formats. I have firsthand experience with designing field experiments and writing models and this has granted me invaluable insight into the quality assurance and control (QA/QC) needs of typical scientific projects.

The bulk of my coding experience is in R but I also have moderate competency with SQL and have self-taught R Shiny. I plan on learning more coding languages going forward as data challenges necessitate.

I firmly believe in transparency in data management and am an avid `git` user. Check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/njlyon0){target="_blank"} for examples of my ongoing and past work!
