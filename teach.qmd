title: "Teaching & Presentations"
---

I'm a deeply enthusiastic person generally and one of the things that brings me the most joy is teaching and learning with others. As such, I have repeatedly sought out opportunities to teach in contexts ranging from hour-long workshops all the way to year-long courses. Also included in this page are guest lectures and conference-style presentations.

See a list of all of these types of teaching below along with--where applicable--additional resources. The icons to the left of the titles (e.g., {{< fa screwdriver-wrench >}}) are intended to help roughly group content by their topic.

## Workshops

This presentation type typically takes between two and six hours, though this instructional time may be divided across two days if the content is sufficiently technical.

Note that these workshops were designed to be offered repeatedly to different audiences. As such, while each of these workshops is only identified once I have been part of the teaching team for all of them _many_ times. All resources are "living" so that participants from earlier iterations of a given workshop find the most up-to-date version of the materials when they revisit their old bookmarks.
