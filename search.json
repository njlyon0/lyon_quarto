For example, I was recently introduced to Conventional Commits which is a system for making more informative commit messages in version control systems.\nI’ve long appreciated that “update” is not an ideal commit message but it can be hard to know which files should be staged into a commit or how much rambling information is useful in the long term. I’ve really enjoyed using this system to formalize both the frequency of my commits and the content of the associated messages."

As an example, your commit might look like:\nfeat: adding code tips to website\nMaking sure a commit fits only a single ‘type’ (and that all of the changes for a particular ‘type’ are in the same commit) has been a really useful scaffold for me. If it’s a breaking change you put a ! after the ‘type’ but before the :.\n\nExample\nI’m doing my best to be consistent in using this system going forward but this  GitHub repository is one good example of my approach to this method."
