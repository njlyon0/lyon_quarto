Among these was a group concerned with the effects of soil phosphorus on carbon and nitrogen (see their full project description here). This group needed a workflow that would allow them to take earlier datasets in a range of formats related to this question and generate a single, analysis-ready table.\nTo meet this need, I developed a flexible workflow that used a living ‘data key’ GoogleSheet to synonymize each datasets’ various columns into a harmonized dataframe (see all project scripts on their  GitHub here). This approach allowed the working group to integrate new data by updating a file in a familiar interface (GoogleSheets) while still ensuring their actual workflow was reproducibly documented in a scripted format."
