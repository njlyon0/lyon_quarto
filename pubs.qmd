title: "Papers"

I have had several opportunities to publish scientific papers both as a lead author and as a member of a larger scientific team. Here are some of the highlights of that record. If any of these links are behind a paywall for you, simply reach out to me and I'll work to get you a PDF. The icons to the left of the titles (e.g., {{< fa bug >}}) are intended to help roughly group content by their topic.

Note that many of these projects have GitHub repositories but they are set to 'Private' until publication. If you would like to use the code in one of these repos, just reach out and we can discuss adding you to the repositories before the papers are published.
