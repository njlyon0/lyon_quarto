I have had several opportunities to publish scientific papers both as a lead author and as a member of a larger scientific team. Here are some of the highlights of that record. If any of these links are behind a paywall, simply reach out to me and I'll work to get you a PDF.

## In-Prep

Note that most of these projects have GitHub repositories but they are set to 'Private' until publication. If you would like to use the code in one of these repos, just reach out and we can discuss adding you to them before the papers are published.
